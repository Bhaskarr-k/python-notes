divided into 2 types they are given below.
                * single value data types
                * collection data types.
  single value data types:
               * integer
               * float
               * boolean
               * complex
collection data types:
               * string
               * list
               * tuple
               * set
integer:
           any number with out deciaml part both positive and negutive consider as a integer.
                ex:
                   x=50
                   print(type(x))
float:
             any  number with deciaml part both positive and negutive is considered as a float.
boolean:
             boolean have only two values true and false.
             in python true considered as one.
             in python false considered as zero.
                      ex:
                          a=true
                          b=false
                          print(a+a)
                          print(b+b)
complex:
             complex data type has two parts real and imaginary.
                 ex: x+yj
                     x--------> real
                    yj--------> imaginary
collection data types:
1.string:
        string is declared uasing single quote(' ') dpuble auotes(" ") and trible quotes (''' ''')
        single line string is declared using single quotes and double quotes where as multiple line string is declared using (''' ''')
        string is ordered data type it can supports indexing(positive and negutive)
        string is immutable data it cant be modified.
2.list:
        elements inside list is declared using squre brackets.
        list is ordered data type it supports indexing.
        list is mutable data type. it can be modified.
        in program list is both homogenous and hetrogenious
        duplicates are allowed in list.
3. tuple:
        elements inside tuple is declared using round brackets.
        tuple is ordered data type.
        tuple is immutable it cant be modified.
        tuple is both homogenous and hetrogenous.
        tuple allowes duplicates.
#### diffrence between list and tuple ####
elements inside   tuple is declared using () round brackets where as in list we can use squre brackets []
tuple is immutable data type where as list us mutable data type.
to decalre single value in tuple(,) comma is mandatorey where as in list comma (,) is not mandatorey.
4. set:
          elements in set is declared using curly brackets{}
          empty set is declared using set () otherwise python will considered a dictionarey.
          it is unordered data type it will not support indexing.
          it is mutable data type it an be modified
          duplicates are not allowed.
          set is both homogenous and hetrogenous type but it allowes only immutable data types.
5. dictionarey:
          elements in dictionarey stored using {} curly brackets.
          elements are stored in the form of "key" and "value" pair.
          key and value pair seperated by (:) key value pair is seperated by comma (,)
          dictionarey is ordered data type.
          dictionarey is mutable data type it can  be modified.
### diffrence between key and value ###
duplicate keys are not allowed if we try to add duplicate is then old value is replace with new value where as duplicate values are allowed.
only immutable keys are allowed where as value can be any data type. only immutable is allowed value can be of any data type.
