open source:
                  freely avaible in internet.
cross platform:
                we can stite code in one operating ssytem and we can run the same code in diffrent operating system with out doing any changes.
high level programing language:
                     high level means human understandble programing language(alphabets).
low level:
            low level means machine understandble.

  case sensitive language:
                      upper and lower alphabets are treated.

                       we cacn write prpgrames using function.
  object oriented programing language:
                               we make use of objects and classes to solve the rela time problems.
