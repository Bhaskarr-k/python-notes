variable:
          Variables are containers for storing data values.
Creating Variables:
                     Python has no command for declaring a variable.
										 A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
        ex:
						x = 5
            y = "John"
            print(x)
            print(y
variable names:
							A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
								
              1.A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
              2.A variable name cannot start with a number
              3.A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
              4.Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
	example:
		myvar = "John"
    my_var = "John"
   _my_var = "John"
    myVar = "John"
   MYVAR = "John"
  myvar2 = "John"
