if: 
  if the given condition is true then comtroll goes inside if block.
  if block is also called as 'TRUE' block.
  for if block else block is not mandatory.
else block:
  if the given condition is false then controll goes to else block.
  else block is also called as 'false block'.
  for else block if block is mandatorey.
ex:
if true:
   print('inside if')
else:
   print('inside else')
ex2:
a,b,c,d=10,20,30,40
if a>b:
  if a>c:
     if a>d:
         print('a' is greater')
     else:
         print('d' is greater')
  else:
       if c>d:
           print('c' is greater')
       else:
           print('d' is greater')
else:
    if b>c:
       if b>d:
          print('b is greater')
       else:
          print('d is greater')
  else:
      if c>d: 
          print('c is greater')
      else:
          print('d is greater')
elif block:
       if previous condition is false then controll goes to elif block.
       for one if block we can write multiple elif blockes.
       if there are multiple conditions to check then we use elif block.
  ex: 
      a,b,c,d,e= 10,11,12,13,14,15
   if a>b and a>c and a>e:
          print('a is greater')
  elif (b>c and b>d and b>c):
         print(' b is greater')
  elif(c>d and e>c):
         print('c is greater')
  elif: d>e
        print('d is greater')
        else
        print('e is greater)
